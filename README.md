# Teensy Android LED Controller

This is a simple android application that uses USB Serial communication via a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller to switch on/off an LED.

The application was made with the help of felHR85's [UsbSerial](https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial) library.

Direct implementation of the project can be found here
